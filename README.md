The Home Room Temperature Monitoring SCADA System is an IoT-based project that continuously measures room temperature and visualizes it using a SCADA-style dashboard. The system reads temperature data from a sensor, logs it in real time, and alerts the user when the temperature moves outside a defined safe range.
